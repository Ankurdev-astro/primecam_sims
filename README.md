# primecam_sims
PrimeCam Simulations for timestream data and Mapmaking
Note: High memory usage expected. Run only on a cluster

Auxiliary files needed: 
[pysm3_map_nside2048_allStokes.fits](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gm4xuhguht5dx848d9e69/pysm3_map_nside2048_allStokes.fits?rlkey=0qga1dkj6442vxrnvku3pcrlx&dl=0)

This file should be put inside `./input_files/`

### First let's start with timestream simulation.

Usage: `python sim_data_primecam.py --test-run`
For full production run: `python sim_data_primecam.py`

This shall create 'ccat_datacenter_mock' dir. All observations are stored here. 
Context dir and Maximum-Likelihood Map outputs will be stored here.

### Next: Processing and Map-making pipeline:

Usage: 
`primecam_integrated_pipeline.py --h5-dirs ./ccat_datacenter_mock/path_to_obs_dir`

`--h5-dir` can take multiple args: to load all obs, for example:
`primecam_integrated_pipeline.py --h5-dirs ./ccat_datacenter_mock/sim_PCAM280_h5_Deep56*`

#### Config file for ML Mapmaker:
```
dump-write: False #Set to True if writing maps at intermediate steps is needed
maxiter: set to a lower value for quick testing
```

#### Converting TOAST HDF5 files to SPT3G format:

TOAST natively supports writing data to disk in HDF5 files.
To convert the produced h5 files into g3, use `scripts/toast_h5_g3.py`

```
Usage: python toast_h5_g3.py [-h] h5_dirs
Example: python toast_h5_g3.py ../ccat_datacenter_mock/path_to_h5_dir
```

This script takes a directory containing h5 files and generates a directory with
corresponding g3 files. If there are multiple h5 directories that need to be processed,
run this script for each of those. The script shall throw an error if the corresponding 
g3 file already exists.
